# The Final Project of Robotic Perception and Intelligence course
Zikun Zhuang

This project Utilize the A* algorithm for path planning, combining ROS2's navigator for robot navigation, ensuring a safe path for the robot on the map from point A to point B and then to point C. At point B, utilize the RealSense depth camera for visual recognition, controlling the robotic arm to grasp specific objects placed nearby, and place the object at point C, finally returning to point A, forming a complete path planning and robotic arm operation process.

Include:
1. The workspace of this project
2. Astar node
3. Navigation node
4. ArmControl node
